# News Article Classification Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying news articles into five distinct categories from the 20 Newsgroups dataset. Various machine learning and deep learning models were implemented and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in text classification.

## Models Used
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model based on the Bayes theorem, using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Neural Network**: A simple architecture with two linear layers trained on TF-IDF data.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Processes sequences by maintaining a state that represents information about previous elements.
- **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**: A type of RNN that can carry information across many time steps.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: An advanced RNN architecture that avoids the long-term dependency problem.
